MVP:
- Grid-based, player moves to each square 
- some squares will have random hidden events that can be positive or negative
- enemies will be visible (except as part of hidden events)
- the player object and enemy class will have 3 stats: HP, STRENGTH, AGILITY, 
- battles will be turn-based and occur in a separate screen from the grid-map
- experience will be rewarded for victories
- player will start at level 1 and move through maps fighting enemies along the way and leveling up
- once a certain experience threshold is reached the player will level up and stats will increase randomly
- items will be granted randomly from both battle and hidden events
- two types of items: consumable and equipment.  Equipment should be rare and affect stats by wide margins
- there will be two ways to move to the next floor: defeating all visible enemies on the map, or finding the hidden exit (hidden event)
- upon completing a floor the player's hp is restored to full
- player should be able to move around the entire map and experience random events as well as planned battles(visible enemies)
- player should have two item slots for equipment and one item slot for consumeables
- player will have the choice of equipping (replacing items) upon discovery
- once floor 10 is reached the game is over and player wins
